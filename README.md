# Toroidal-Propeller-Parametric-Study-
Using data collected from a Solidworks Flow Simulation parametric study, the thrust and efficiency values were found for a range of input dimensions and conditions. Using SciKit Learn, linear regression was performed to identify the effect of each dimension and condition on both thrust and efficiency.
The accuracy of the model is given in the below images, with each data point representing (predicted value, actual value) for the test set.

Further information on the collection, significance, and discussion of data can be found in the attached copy of my research paper. The collected data and experimental setup may also be explored in the linked Solidworks files.
