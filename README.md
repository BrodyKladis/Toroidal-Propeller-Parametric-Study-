# Toroidal-Propeller-Parametric-Study-
Using data collected from a Solidworks Flow Simulation parametric study, the thrust and efficiency values were found for a range of input dimensions and conditions. Using SciKit Learn, linear regression was preformed to identify the effect of each dimension and condition on both thrust and efficiency.
